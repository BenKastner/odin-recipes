    <h1>Tofu Scramble</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This quick scramble is a combination of flavors and textures that will surprise and delight tofu-lovers and doubters alike. Soy sauce, turmeric and cumin provide bold seasoning, while searing the block of tofu on both sides before breaking it up yields plenty of crispy bits as well as tender ones. You can add cooked vegetables, leafy greens, beans, cheese or nutritional yeast with the scallions in Step 4, though you may want to increase the seasoning depending on the amount of extras you add. You can also swap in hot sauce, mustard or tahini for the soy sauce and play around with spice combinations, but don’t skip the splash of water — it helps the tofu soak up all the flavors. Serve with toast, tortillas, salad or breakfast potatoes.</p>
